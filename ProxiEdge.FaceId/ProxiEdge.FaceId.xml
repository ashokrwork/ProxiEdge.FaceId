            Detect human faces in an image, return face rectangles, and optionally with faceIds, landmarks, and attributes.
            Optional parameters including faceId, landmarks, and attributes.
            Attributes include age, gender, headPose, smile, facialHair, glasses, emotion, hair, makeup, occlusion, accessories, blur, exposure and noise.
            faceId will be used in Face - Identify, Face - Verify, and Face - Find Similar.It will expire 24 hours after the detection call.
            Higher face image quality means better detection and recognition precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.
            JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported.The allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.
            Faces are detectable when its size is 36x36 to 4096x4096 pixels.If need to detect very small but clear faces, please try to enlarge the input image.
            Up to 64 faces can be returned for an image. Faces are ranked by face rectangle size from large to small.
            Face detector prefer frontal and near-frontal faces. There are cases that faces may not be detected, e.g.exceptionally large face angles (head-pose) or being occluded, or wrong image orientation.
            Attributes(age, gender, headPose, smile, facialHair, glasses, emotion, hair, makeup, occlusion, accessories, blur, exposure and noise) may not be perfectly accurate.HeadPose's pitch value is a reserved field and will always return 0.

            <summary>
            Given query face's faceId, to search the similar-looking faces from a faceId array, a face list or a large face list. 
            faceId array contains the faces created by Face - Detect, which will expire 24 hours after creation. 
            A "faceListId" is created by FaceList - Create containing persistedFaceIds that will not expire. 
            And a "largeFaceListId" is created by LargeFaceList - Create containing persistedFaceIds that will also not expire. 
            Depending on the input the returned similar faces list contains faceIds or persistedFaceIds ranked by similarity. 
            Find similar has two working modes, "matchPerson" and "matchFace". 
            "matchPerson" is the default mode that it tries to find faces of the same person as possible by using internal same-person thresholds.
            It is useful to find a known person's other photos. Note that an empty list will be returned if no faces pass the internal thresholds. 
            "matchFace" mode ignores same-person thresholds and returns ranked similar faces anyway, even the similarity is low. 
            It can be used in the cases like searching celebrity-looking faces.
